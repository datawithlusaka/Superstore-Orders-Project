### Data sources
This dataset was downloaded from Google Datasets. It consists of over 50k rows and ranges of data from all over the world with various products. It consists of 24 unique columns. It shows all the sales, profit and discounts of very many products.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
•	Data filtering- I displayed only the rows that met certain criteria, making it easier to focus on specific information in a large dataset. Here's a basic guide on how to filter data in Excel.

•	Data Deduplication- It involved removing duplicate records or entries from the dataset in order to maintain data accuracy and consistency. In Excel, you can perform data deduplication using various methods. It removes entire rows that are considered duplicates based on the selected columns. 

•	Data validation- It helped control what kind of data can be entered into a cell. It ensures data accuracy and consistency by defining rules or criteria for the input. It is a powerful tool for maintaining data integrity in your Excel sheets. It helps prevent errors and ensures that data adheres to specified criteria, making your spreadsheets more accurate and reliable.

•	Data Aggregation-In this process I created the total sales and also organized the profits and quantities to enable easy exploration and presentation of data.

•	Data Cleansing- is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset, table, or database. It involves identifying incomplete, incorrect, irrelevant, etc., parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting this dirty data. In Excel, data cleansing might involve several steps, depending on the complexity and nature of your data. Ensuring that your data follows a consistent format, is especially important for dates, categorizations, and any text-based information. Sometimes, numbers are formatted as text, which can prevent calculations or logical operations. Outliers can affect averages and other statistical calculations. Missing data can lead to biased analysis and incorrect conclusions.
